# heatpumpMonitor by Robert Penz

With this software you can monitor Stiebel Eltron LWZ heat pumps via a serial interface from your Linux server. It generates nice diagrams you can watch via a web browser. Additional features like alarming via email are integrated.

Important: I currently don't have the time to code on heatpumpmonitor - it does what I need --> so this project needs new developers to add additional functionality.

## Fork

This is my personal fork of the original software as it's currently [hosted on Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/heatpumpmonitor). My goal is to use this to read my heatpump data and store it in my InfluxDB.
